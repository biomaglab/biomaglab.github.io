   abstract = {Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a valuable tool for non-invasive brain stimulation. Currently, nTMS requires fixing of markers on the patient’s head. Head marker displacements lead to changes in coil placement and brain stimulation inaccuracy. A markerless neuronavigation method is needed to increase the reliability of nTMS and simplify the nTMS protocol. In this study, we introduce and release MarLe, a Python markerless head tracker neuronavigation software for TMS. This novel software uses computer-vision techniques combined with low-cost cameras to estimate the head pose for neuronavigation. A coregistration algorithm, based on a closed-form solution, was designed to track the patient’s head and the TMS coil referenced to the individual’s brain image. We show that MarLe can estimate head pose based on real-time video processing. An intuitive pipeline was developed to connect the MarLe and nTMS neuronavigation software. MarLe achieved acceptable accuracy and stability in a mockup nTMS experiment. MarLe allows real-time tracking of the patient’s head without any markers. The combination of face detection and a coregistration algorithm can overcome nTMS head marker displacement concerns. MarLe can improve reliability, simplify, and reduce the protocol time of brain intervention techniques such as nTMS.},

   abstract = {Most of the motor mapping procedures using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) follow the conventional somatotopic organization of the primary motor cortex (M1) by assessing the representation of a particular target muscle, disregarding the possible coactivation of synergistic muscles. In turn, multiple reports describe a functional organization of the M1 with an overlapping among motor representations acting together to execute movements. In this context, the overlap degree among cortical representations of synergistic hand and forearm muscles remains an open question. This study aimed to evaluate the muscle coactivation and representation overlapping common to the grasping movement and its dependence on the stimulation parameters. The nTMS motor maps were obtained from one carpal muscle and two intrinsic hand muscles during rest. We quantified the overlapping motor maps in size (area and volume overlap degree) and topography (similarity and centroid Euclidean distance) parameters. We demonstrated that these muscle representations are highly overlapped and similar in shape. The overlap degrees involving the forearm muscle were significantly higher than only among the intrinsic hand muscles. Moreover, the stimulation intensity had a stronger effect on the size compared to the topography parameters. Our study contributes to a more detailed cortical motor representation towards a synergistic, functional arrangement of M1. Understanding the muscle group coactivation may provide more accurate motor maps when delineating the eloquent brain tissue during pre-surgical planning.},

   abstract = {Objective: There seems to be no consensus in the literature regarding the protocol of surface electromyography (sEMG) electrode placement for recording motor evoked potentials (MEP) in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applications. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the MEP amplitude bytwo different protocols for electrode placement. Methods: SEMG electrodes were placed on three upper arm muscles (biceps brachii, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor pollicis brevis) of six right-handed subjects following two different protocols (1 and 2), which varied according to the interelectrode distance and location relative to the muscle. TMS pulses were applied to the hotspot of biceps brachii, while sEMGwas recorded from the two protocols and for each muscle simultaneously. Main Results: Greater MEP amplitudes were obtained for Protocol 1 compared to Protocol 2 (P < 0.05). Significance: Different electrode placement protocols may result in distinct MEP amplitudes, which should be taken into account when adjusting the intensity on single and repetitive TMS sessions.},

   abstract = {A estimulação magnética transcraniana é um método não invasivo de estimulação do córtex humano. Conhecida pela sigla TMS, do inglês transcranial magnetic stimulation, a técnica foi introduzida por Barker et al. em 1985. Seu funcionamento baseia-se na Lei de Faraday, na qual um intenso campo magnético que varia rapidamente é capaz de induzir um campo elétrico na superfície do cérebro, despolarizando os neurônios no córtex cerebral. Devido à sua versatilidade, a TMS é utilizada atualmente tanto no âmbito da pesquisa quanto em aplicações clínicas. Entre as aplicações clínicas, a TMS é utilizada como ferramenta diagnóstica e também como técnica terapêutica de algumas doenças neurodegenerativas e distúrbios psiquiátricos como a depressão, a doença de Parkinson e o tinnitus. Quanto à ferramenta diagnóstica, destaca-se o mapeamento motor, uma técnica de delimitação da área de representação do músculo-alvo em sua superfície cortical, cuja aplicabilidade pode ser em estudos da fisiologia cerebral para avaliar danos ao córtex motor e trato corticoespinhal. Esta revisão teve como objetivo introduzir a física, os elementos básicos, os princípios biológicos e as principais aplicações da TMS.},

   abstract = {The investigation of magnetic nanoparticles for medical and biological applications is relatively recent and steadily growing. When properly functionalized, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can target cancer cells and deliver a drug or heat to these cells. MNPs are being investigated in several applications in medicine such as hyperthermia, magnetic particle imaging, cell separation and magnetofection, in vitro and in vivo alternating current biosusceptibility, T1 and T2 magnetic resonance contrast agents, and magnetorelaxometry. In each of these applications, a specific physical property is measured. Magnetorelaxometry relies on the fact that when MNPs are magnetized they can relax by the Brownian and Néel mechanisms. Both mechanisms depend on the MNP size and for certain conditions can have a faster relaxation through the Brownian, compared to the Néel, mechanism. This can be exploited to target cells. For certain sizes, when an MNP is free to rotate in the biological fluids, they will relax faster than when attached to a cell. This can provide a high contrast for detection of magnetically-labelled cancer cells, making it possible to differentiate normal from cancer tissue. Until very recently SQUIDs were the main detectors employed to measure MNPs, but Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPM) are now an attractive alternative. OPMs are smaller, do not need liquid helium, and are simpler to operate than SQUIDs. Here, we present the initial steps of the development of an OPM-based instrument to measure relaxation of MNP in vitro.},

   abstract = {Background: Neuronavigation provides visual guidance of an instrument during procedures of neurological interventions, and has been shown to be a valuable tool for accurately positioning transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coils relative to an individual's anatomy. Despite the importance of neuronavigation, its high cost, low portability, and low availability of magnetic resonance imaging facilities limit its insertion in research and clinical environments. New method: We have developed and validated the InVesalius Navigator as the first free, open-source software for image-guided navigated TMS, compatible with multiple tracking devices. A point-based, co-registration algorithm and a guiding interface were designed for tracking any instrument (e.g. TMS coils) relative to an individual's anatomy. Results: Localization, precision errors, and repeatability were measured for two tracking devices during navigation in a phantom and in a simulated TMS study. Errors were measured in two commercial navigated TMS systems for comparison. Localization error was about 1.5 mm, and repeatability was about 1 mm for translation and 1° for rotation angles, both within limits established in the literature. Comparison with existing methods: Existing TMS neuronavigation software programs are not compatible with multiple tracking devices, and do not provide an easy to implement platform for custom tools. Moreover, commercial alternatives are expensive with limited portability. Conclusions: InVesalius Navigator might contribute to improving spatial accuracy and the reliability of techniques for brain interventions by means of an intuitive graphical interface. Furthermore, the software can be easily integrated into existing neuroimaging tools, and customized for novel applications such as multi-locus and/or controllable-pulse TMS.},

   abstract = {Background: Training in medical education depends on the availability of standardized materials that can reliably mimic the human anatomy and physiology. One alternative to using cadavers or animal bodies is to employ phantoms or mimicking devices. Styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) gels are biologically inert and present tunable properties, including mechanical properties that resemble the soft tissue. Therefore, SEBS is an alternative to develop a patient-specific phantom, that provides real visual and morphological experience during simulation-based neurosurgical training. Results: A 3D model was reconstructed and printed based on patient-specific magnetic resonance images. The fused deposition of polyactic acid (PLA) filament and selective laser sintering of polyamid were used for 3D printing. Silicone and SEBS materials were employed to mimic soft tissues. A neuronavigation protocol was performed on the 3D-printed models scaled to three different sizes, 100%, 50%, and 25% of the original dimensions. A neurosurgery team (17 individuals) evaluated the phantom realism as "very good" and "perfect" in 49% and 31% of the cases, respectively, and rated phantom utility as "very good" and "perfect" in 61% and 32% of the cases, respectively. Models in original size (100%) and scaled to 50% provided a quantitative and realistic visual analysis of the patient's cortical anatomy without distortion. However, reduction to one quarter of the original size (25%) hindered visualization of surface details and identification of anatomical landmarks.},

   abstract = {This study is the first step in an effort to develop three-dimensional (3D) printing for use in pediatric surgical planning. In order to accomplish this, we established an effective collaboration between Ribeirao Preto Clinics Hospital (HCRP) and Renato Archer Center for Information Technology (CTI). Printed biomodels can be used to support discussions, decision-making, and neuronavigation before surgery. The main purpose of 3D printing for specific case handling is to reduce damage by enhancing knowledge of orientation during surgical planning and personnel training before surgery. Here, we produced an object that represented the brain and face segment of a patient via additive manufacturing technology based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Specific landmarks were measured by three distinct methods: manual caliper, an InVesalius software measurement tool, and neuronavigation coordinate detection. The mean coefficient of variation was 7.17% between all methods and landmarks measured. Our results validate the combined use of biomodels with InVesalius software tools for the assessment of individual brain anatomy facilitating manual handling and visualization of 3D models. The establishment of communication protocols between the teams involved, as well as navigation protocols for quality control, presents the possibility of developing long term training programs, and promotes the congregation of individuals from research areas in Medical Physics, Medical Sciences, and Neuroscience.},
