Signal Hunter is a free software developed in MATLAB 8.1 language that has been developed to incorporate MEP Hunter functions in a more user-friendly interface and with new possibilities for collaborative development. The goal of Signal Hunter is to provide interfaces and algorithms for processing electrophysiological data in general.

Currently, it is being used by Prof. Sarah Dias from EEFERP-USP for processing electromyography signals and potentials evoked by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Signal Hunter also has an interface for processing motor evoked potentials (MEPs) acquired with Signal software in conjunction with TMS Magstim, developed for the Functional Electrostimulation Laboratory at UFBA.

New applications can be incorporated according to the researcher's needs.

The development of Signal Hunter as free software allows research center users and academic environments to use it for research and teaching purposes.
