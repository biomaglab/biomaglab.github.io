# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio:  I am currently a research professor at the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neurosciences - Instituto Santos Dumont. My academic interest is centered on the dynamics of sensory processing, the integration between sensory systems and how information from the environment is perceived by individuals. In human studies, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with machine learning techniques to understand how semantic categories are organized in the brain.
